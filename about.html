</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Hi, I’m Algon-33 I’m interested in understanding understanding, the foundations of reality and origami. Put a less obnoxious way, I'd like to know how our minds work, how the minds we make work, and how all minds should work. So think computationally bounded Bayesianism, funcitonal neuroscience/figuring out deep learning and logic/decision theory/comptability. That ties into what we can/can't know, which is why I really want to dig into complexity theory. Most all physics is beutiful, but I've had a thing for quantum foundations, chaotic systems and thermodynamics for a while.</p>
<p>I’m currently learning about how to implement a transformer, algorithms to use large language models as writing aids and what to expect out of GPT-4. Also topology: need to prove Brouwer's fixed point theorem. I think I can do it by using ever finer meshes and trying to find open/closed sets whose images overlap with themselves.</p>
<p>I’m looking to collaborate on any ML experiments people find interesting, especially related to interpetability, SGD priors, training path dependancy and grokking.</p>
<p>Or if you want me to do some research for you, I'm game. For $50/hour, you can get me working on a literature review of anything you like. My most recent work was a non-comprehensive [ref]If it were comprehensive, I'd have been working for a year[\ref] survey of ambitious methods of education. </p>
